# Pan at Clef 2023 Trigger-Detection Proposed Solution

The current code presents my approach for the shared task [Pan at Clef 2023 Trigger-Detection](https://pan.webis.de/clef23/pan23-web/trigger-detection.html).
This repository contains a [scientific report](Scientific_Report.pdf) explaining the applied approaches as well as a [brief presentation](Presentation.pdf).

Please be aware that, due to legal constraints, I'm unable to share the dataset used in this project. Consequently, it is not included in this repository.
Furthermore, it's essential to note that due to tight time constraints and the urgency of meeting competition/task deadlines, the code might deviate at some parts from to the high quality standards I usually maintain.
